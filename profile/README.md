Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an experienced software developer with a passion for creating efficient and scalable applications. My primary focus lies in back-end development, but I also enjoy working on full-stack projects that allow me to explore the front-end world.

I have extensive experience with programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java. My primary tech stack includes Node.js for server-side applications, React for user interfaces, and MongoDB for database management. I am also familiar with various frameworks and tools, including Express.js, Django, and Docker, which I leverage to improve development processes and deliver high-quality software.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and adhere to Agile methodologies to ensure timely project delivery. My approach often involves continuous collaboration with team members and conducting thorough code reviews to foster a culture of learning and improvement. Additionally, I stay updated with the latest trends in technology and enjoy exploring emerging tools that can enhance my workflow.

Some of my favorite projects include developing a real-time chat application, building an e-commerce platform from scratch, and contributing to open-source projects that aim to improve community-driven solutions. I also have a strong interest in data science and machine learning, and I am currently working on integrating AI capabilities into my applications.
